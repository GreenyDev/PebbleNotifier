# PebbleNotifier
Posts a Notification when connected to a Pebble device via Bluetooth. Tiny preview can be found on my Youtube [here](https://t.co/Wj4x68dfKL).

#Bugs
I don't want to, or need to know about the fact that notifications come up multiple times. Apart from that everything else should be working. To report bugs, please do so via Github [here](https://github.com/GreenyDev/PebbleNotifier/issues/new). If you don't have a Github account/don't want one, feel free to contact me on Twitter [here](http://www.twitter.com/GreenyDev/)

#How to Install?
I don't recommend installing in it's current state because of bugs that I've mentioned above, but if curiosity gets the better of you or you just want it, here's how to do so.
